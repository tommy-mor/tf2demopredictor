get timeseries data for mouse movement of players
collect dataset of invite teams, detect which class each person is playing
  eventually collect dataset for invite teams, identify which player it is.
    maybe just sample latent space of something and cosinesimilarity difference to identify player

implement transformer from paper, but for timeseries classification
